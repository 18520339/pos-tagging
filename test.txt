The
economy
's
temperature
will
be
taken
from
several
vantage
points
this
week
,
with
readings
on
trade
,
output
,
housing
and
inflation
.

The
most
troublesome
report
may
be
the
August
merchandise
trade
deficit
due
out
tomorrow
.

The
trade
gap
is
expected
to
widen
to
about
$
9
billion
from
July
's
$
7.6
billion
,
according
to
a
survey
by
MMS
International
,
a
unit
of
McGraw-Hill
Inc.
,
New
York
.

Thursday
's
report
on
the
September
consumer
price
index
is
expected
to
rise
,
although
not
as
sharply
as
the
0.9
%
gain
reported
Friday
in
the
producer
price
index
.

That
gain
was
being
cited
as
a
reason
the
stock
market
was
down
early
in
Friday
's
session
,
before
it
got
started
on
its
reckless
190-point
plunge
.

Economists
are
divided
as
to
how
much
manufacturing
strength
they
expect
to
see
in
September
reports
on
industrial
production
and
capacity
utilization
,
also
due
tomorrow
.

Meanwhile
,
September
housing
starts
,
due
Wednesday
,
are
thought
to
have
inched
upward
.

``
There
's
a
possibility
of
a
surprise
''
in
the
trade
report
,
said
Michael
Englund
,
director
of
research
at
MMS
.

A
widening
of
the
deficit
,
if
it
were
combined
with
a
stubbornly
strong
dollar
,
would
exacerbate
trade
problems
--
but
the
dollar
weakened
Friday
as
stocks
plummeted
.

In
any
event
,
Mr.
Englund
and
many
others
say
that
the
easy
gains
in
narrowing
the
trade
gap
have
already
been
made
.

``
Trade
is
definitely
going
to
be
more
politically
sensitive
over
the
next
six
or
seven
months
as
improvement
begins
to
slow
,
''
he
said
.

Exports
are
thought
to
have
risen
strongly
in
August
,
but
probably
not
enough
to
offset
the
jump
in
imports
,
economists
said
.

Views
on
manufacturing
strength
are
split
between
economists
who
read
September
's
low
level
of
factory
job
growth
as
a
sign
of
a
slowdown
and
those
who
use
the
somewhat
more
comforting
total
employment
figures
in
their
calculations
.

The
wide
range
of
estimates
for
the
industrial
output
number
underscores
the
differences
:
The
forecasts
run
from
a
drop
of
0.5
%
to
an
increase
of
0.4
%
,
according
to
MMS
.

A
rebound
in
energy
prices
,
which
helped
push
up
the
producer
price
index
,
is
expected
to
do
the
same
in
the
consumer
price
report
.

The
consensus
view
expects
a
0.4
%
increase
in
the
September
CPI
after
a
flat
reading
in
August
.

Robert
H.
Chandross
,
an
economist
for
Lloyd
's
Bank
in
New
York
,
is
among
those
expecting
a
more
moderate
gain
in
the
CPI
than
in
prices
at
the
producer
level
.

``
Auto
prices
had
a
big
effect
in
the
PPI
,
and
at
the
CPI
level
they
wo
n't
,
''
he
said
.

Food
prices
are
expected
to
be
unchanged
,
but
energy
costs
jumped
as
much
as
4
%
,
said
Gary
Ciminero
,
economist
at
Fleet_Norstar
Financial
Group
.

He
also
says
he
thinks
``
core
inflation
,
''
which
excludes
the
volatile
food
and
energy
prices
,
was
strong
last
month
.

He
expects
a
gain
of
as
much
as
0.5
%
in
core
inflation
after
a
summer
of
far
smaller
increases
.

Housing
starts
are
expected
to
quicken
a
bit
from
August
's
annual
pace
of
1,350,000
units
.

Economists
say
an
August
rebound
in
permits
for
multifamily
units
signaled
an
increase
in
September
starts
,
though
activity
remains
fairly
modest
by
historical
standards
.

Assuming
the
stock
market
does
n't
crash
again
and
completely
discredit
yuppies
and
trading
rooms
,
American
television
audiences
in
a
few
months
may
be
seeing
Britain
's
concept
of
both
.

``
Capital
City
''
is
a
weekly
series
that
premiered
here
three
weeks
ago
amid
unprecedented
hype
by
its
producer
,
Thames
Television
.

The
early
episodes
make
you
long
for
a
rerun
of
the
crash
of
1987
.

Let
's
make
that
1929
,
just
to
be
sure
.

According
to
the
program
's
publicity
prospectus
,
``
Capital
City
,
''
set
at
Shane
Longman
,
a
fictional
mid-sized
securities
firm
with
#
500
million
capital
,
``
follows
the
fortunes
of
a
close-knit
team
of
young
,
high-flying
dealers
,
hired
for
their
particular
blend
of
style
,
genius
and
energy
.

But
with
all
the
money
and
glamour
of
high
finance
come
the
relentless
pressures
to
do
well
;
pressure
to
pull
off
another
million
before
lunch
;
pressure
to
anticipate
the
market
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
...
''

You
need
n't
be
a
high-powered
securities
lawyer
to
realize
the
prospectus
is
guilty
of
less
than
full
disclosure
.

The
slickly
produced
series
has
been
criticized
by
London
's
financial
cognoscenti
as
inaccurate
in
detail
,
but
its
major
weakness
is
its
unrealistic
depiction
of
the
characters
'
professional
and
private
lives
.

Turned
loose
in
Shane
Longman
's
trading
room
,
the
yuppie
dealers
do
little
right
.

Judging
by
the
money
lost
and
mistakes
made
in
the
early
episodes
,
Shane
Longman
's
capital
should
be
just
about
exhausted
by
the
final
13th
week
.

In
the
opening
episode
we
learn
that
Michelle
,
a
junior
bond
trader
,
has
indeed
pulled
off
another
million
before
lunch
.

Trouble
is
,
she
has
lost
it
just
as
quickly
.

Rather
than
keep
the
loss
a
secret
from
the
outside
world
,
Michelle
blabs
about
it
to
a
sandwich
man
while
ordering
lunch
over
the
phone
.

Little
chance
that
Shane
Longman
is
going
to
recoup
today
.

Traders
spend
the
morning
frantically
selling
bonds
,
in
the
belief
that
the
U.S.
monthly
trade
figures
will
look
lousy
.

Ah
,
perfidious
Columbia
!

The
trade
figures
turn
out
well
,
and
all
those
recently
unloaded
bonds
spurt
in
price
.

So
much
for
anticipating
the
market
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
.

And
a
large
slice
of
the
first
episode
is
devoted
to
efforts
to
get
rid
of
some
nearly
worthless
Japanese
bonds
(
since
when
is
anything
Japanese
nearly
worthless
nowadays
?
)
.

Surprisingly
,
Shane
Longman
survives
the
week
,
only
to
have
a
senior
executive
innocently
bumble
his
way
into
becoming
the
target
of
a
criminal
insider
trading
investigation
.

Instead
of
closing
ranks
to
protect
the
firm
's
reputation
,
the
executive
's
internal
rivals
,
led
by
a
loutish
American
,
demand
his
resignation
.

The
plot
is
thwarted
when
the
firm
's
major
stockholder
,
kelp
farming
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
,
hurries
home
to
support
the
executive
.

But
the
investigation
continues
.

If
you
can
swallow
the
premise
that
the
rewards
for
such
ineptitude
are
six-figure
salaries
,
you
still
are
left
puzzled
,
because
few
of
the
yuppies
consume
very
conspicuously
.

In
fact
,
few
consume
much
of
anything
.

Two
share
a
house
almost
devoid
of
furniture
.

Michelle
lives
in
a
hotel
room
,
and
although
she
drives
a
canary-colored
Porsche
,
she
has
n't
time
to
clean
or
repair
it
;
the
beat-up
vehicle
can
be
started
only
with
a
huge
pair
of
pliers
because
the
ignition
key
has
broken
off
in
the
lock
.

And
it
takes
Declan
,
the
obligatory
ladies
'
man
of
the
cast
,
until
the
third
episode
to
get
past
first
base
with
any
of
his
prey
.

Perhaps
the
explanation
for
these
anomalies
is
that
class-conscious
Britain
is
n't
ready
to
come
to
terms
with
the
wealth
created
by
the
Thatcherian
free-enterprise
regime
.

After
all
,
this
is
n't
old
money
,
but
new
money
,
and
in
many
cases
,
young
money
.

This
attitude
is
clearly
illustrated
in
the
treatment
of
Max
,
the
trading
room
's
most
flamboyant
character
.
